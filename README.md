# ICE3_Weather_Prediction_Algorithm

# Overview
>The main functionalities of the project is that we are focusing on the **"Weather-Based Activity Predictor."** The goal of this project is to predict the best outdoor activity based on simple weather conditions.
### **How it works:**
- The input features might include:
    - Temperature (Hot, Mild, Cold)
    - Rain (Yes, No)        
    - Wind Speed (High, Low)
- The **decision tree** would classify activities such as:
    - If **hot & no rain**, then **go for a picnic**.   
    - If **cold & high wind**, then **stay indoors**.
    - If **mild & no rain**, then **go jogging**.
